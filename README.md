# Traffic-Density-Estimation-Using-Mask-RCNN
Traffic Density Estimation Using Mask RCNN

To run this program you need to run requirements.txt 

  !python install -r requirements.txt

Then run setup.py ao that mask rcnn modules is installed.

  !python setup.py install
  
Then run object_counting.py

  !python object_counting.py
  
In this project, I am using Mask RCNN as an object detection algorithm which detects object in an image. After object detection, I am calculating the vehicles and pedestrians in an image. Depending upon the vehicle and pedestrian count, I am estimating the traffic density as high, low, medium traffic.
